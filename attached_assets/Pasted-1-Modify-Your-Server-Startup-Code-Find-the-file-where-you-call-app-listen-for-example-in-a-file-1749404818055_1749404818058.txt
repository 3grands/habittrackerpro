1. Modify Your Server Startup Code
Find the file where you callâ€¯app.listen()â€¯(for example, in a file likeâ€¯server/start.ts). Instead of unconditionally starting the server, wrap the listen call in an environment check.

For example, update your server startup code (either inâ€¯server/start.ts or in the file that originally contained the listen call) as follows:

ts
Copy
Edit
import app from "./index"; // assuming app is exported from index.ts

// Only start the server if we are not in "build mode"
if (process.env.SKIP_SERVER_START !== "true") {
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server running on port ${PORT}`);
  });
} else {
  console.log("SKIP_SERVER_START is true: not starting the server.");
}
This means that when an environment variable SKIP_SERVER_START is set to "true", the code that callsâ€¯app.listen()â€¯will be bypassed. This prevents any server startup code from running during the build process.

2. Update Your Build Script in package.json
Tell your build process to set this environment variable so that the server wonâ€™t start during the build.

For example, in your package.json adjust the build script to look like this:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "SKIP_SERVER_START=true vite build && esbuild server/start.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/server.js",
  "preview": "vite preview --port=$PORT",
  "start": "node dist/server.js"
}
When you runâ€¯npm run build, the SKIP_SERVER_START variable will be set to "true", so even if your server files are imported, they wonâ€™t attempt to listen on port 5000 during the build.

3. Rebuild and Redeploy
Now perform these commands in your Replit Shell to clean and rebuild:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
Then click Redeploy in Replit.

4. Verify at Runtime
When your app is actually started in production (or when you run the startup command manually), make sure that the SKIP_SERVER_START environment variable is not set. That way, your server will properly start:

Locally, you can run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
On Replit, Cloud Run should execute the built file without the build-time variable interfering.
